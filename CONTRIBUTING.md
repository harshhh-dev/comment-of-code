# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in wanting to contribute to the comment of code project! Before starting, it is my wish you take a quick peek at these 
guidelines I have set for the contributors of this project.

1. [Issues]
2. [Pull requests]
3. [Guide for Noobs]

## Issues 

If you want to suggest extra languages, fix typos, and/or fix syntax, please open an issue!

I try to give each issue to individual attention it deserves, but still - be patient until we get to yours!

I've created a few issue templates (for example for features requests or bug reports), which you are intended to use. If the type of issue you want to
create doesn't fit a template, feel free to create an issue from scratch, but still include sufficient information for us to understand it.

## Pull Requests 

If you worked on a new language, fixed a typo and/or a sytax issue, please create a pull request so we can merge your work into ours.

If it is not immediately apparent what you added or which issue you addressed, please include an adequate description in your pull request. 
If you still need to work on the pull request before it can be merged please open it as a draft.

We review every pull request, and I would appreciate it if you would accept the changes that we propose during our reviews.

## Guide For Noobs

Contributing for the first time? I have you covered :wink: 

  - Click "Fork" at the top of the page (There's also a star button right next to it :wink:)
  - Clone the repository into your PC. Go to your terminal of choice (which has Git support), type in `git clone url`
  - Create a new branch (`git branch name`) 
  - Switch to that branch (`git checkout name`)
  - Do what you need to :slight_smile:
  - After making your changes, just do `git add file`
  - Commit your file (`git commit -m "Your Message"`
  - After that, push the branch (`git push origin name`)
  - Create a pull request. 
  
 You're all set now :smile:
